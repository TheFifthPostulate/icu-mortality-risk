-- Query 1: GCS long format extraction
-- Follows the same structure as mimiciv_ext_icumort_signal24h_extract_1.sql
-- GCS total: 3-15, normal = 15 (fully alert)
-- GCS motor: 1-6, normal = 6
-- GCS verbal: 1-5, normal = 5
-- GCS eyes: 1-4, normal = 4
-- Safe ranges: "normal" is max score; lower scores indicate impairment
-- For GCS, safe_min is set at thresholds below which concern increases
